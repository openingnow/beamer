\section{Compatibility and Emulation}


\subsection{Compatibility with Other Packages and Classes}

When using certain packages or classes together with the |beamer|
class, extra options or precautions may be necessary.

\begin{package}{{AlDraTex}}
  Graphics created using AlDraTex must be treated like verbatim
  text. The reason is that DraTex fiddles with catcodes and spaces
  much like verbatim does. So, in order to insert a picture, either
  add the |containsverbatim| option to the frame or use the
  |\defverbatim| command to create a box containing the picture.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{alltt}}
  Text in an |alltt| environment must be treated like verbatim
  text. So add the |containsverbatim| option to frames containing this
  environment or use |\defverbatim|.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{amsthm}}
  This package is automatically loaded since \beamer\ uses it for
  typesetting theorems. If you do not wish it to be loaded, which can
  be necessary especially in |article| mode if the package is
  incompatible with the document class, you can use the class option
  |noamsthm| to suppress its loading. See
  Section~\ref{section-theorems} for more details.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{babel}|[|\declare{|french|}|]|}
  When using the |french| style, certain features that clash with the
  functionality of the \beamer\ class will be turned off. For example,
  enumerations are still produced the way the theme dictates, not the
  way the |french| style does.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{babel}|[|\declare{|spanish|}|]|}
  \beamernote
  When using the |spanish| style, certain features that clash with the
  functionality of the \beamer\ class will be turned off. In particular,
  the special behaviour of the pointed brackets |<| and |>| is
  deactivated. 

  \articlenote
  To make the characters |<| and |>| active in |article| mode, pass
  the option |activeospeccharacters| to the package
  |beamerbasearticle|. This will lead to
  problems with overlay specifications.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{color}}
  \beamernote
  The |color| package is automatically loaded by |beamer.cls|. This
  makes it impossible to pass options to |color| in the preamble of
  your document. To pass a \meta{list of options} to |color|, you must
  use the following class option:

  \begin{classoption}{{color={\normalfont\meta{list of options}}}}
    Causes the \meta{list of options} to be passed on to the |color|
    package. If the \meta{list of options} contains more than one
    option you must enclose it in curly brackets.
  \end{classoption}

  \articlenote
  The |color| package is not loaded automatically if
  |beamerarticle| is loaded with the |noxcolor| option.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{CJK}}
  \beamernote
  When using the |CJK| package for using Asian fonts, you must use the
  class option \declare{|CJK|}. See |beamerexample4.tex| for an
  example. 
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{deluxetable}}
  \beamernote
  The caption generation facilities of |deluxetable| are
  deactivated. Instead, the caption template is used.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{DraTex}}
  See |AlDraTex|.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{enumerate}}
  \articlenote
  This package is loaded automatically in the |presentation| modes, but not
  in the |article| mode. If you use its features, you have to load the
  package ``by hand'' in the |article| mode.
\end{package}

\begin{class}{{foils}}
  If you wish to emulate the |foils| class using \beamer, please see
  Section~\ref{section-foiltex}.
\end{class}

\begin{package}{{fontenc}|[|\declare{|T1|}|]|}
  Use this option only with fonts that have outline fonts available in
  the T1 encoding like Times or the |lmodern| fonts. In a standard
  installation the standard Computer Modern fonts (the fonts Donald
  Knuth originally designed and which are used by default) are
  \emph{not} available in the T1 encoding. Using this  option with
  them will result in very poor rendering of your presentation when
  viewed with \pdf\ viewer applications like Acrobat or |xpdf|. To use
  the Computer Modern fonts with the T1 encoding, use the package
  |lmodern|.  See also Section~\ref{section-font-encoding}.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{fourier}}
  The package switches to a T1~encoding, but it does not redefine all
  fonts such that outline fonts (non-bitmapped fonts) are used by
  default. For example, the sans-serif text and the typewriter text
  are not replaced. To use outline fonts for these, write
  |\usepackage{lmodern}| \emph{before} including the |fourier|
  package. 
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{HA-prosper}}
  You cannot use this package with \beamer. However, you might try to
  use the package |beamerprosper| instead, see
  Section~\ref{section-prosper}. 
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{hyperref}}
  \beamernote
  The |hyperref| package is automatically loaded by |beamer.cls| and
  certain options are setup. In order pass additional options to
  |hyperref| or to override options, you can use the following class
  option: 

  \begin{classoption}{{hyperref={\normalfont\meta{list of options}}}}
    Causes the \meta{list of options} to be passed on to the |hyperref|
    package.

    \example |\documentclass[hyperref={bookmarks=false}]{beamer}|
  \end{classoption}

  Alternatively, you can also use the |\hypersetup| command.

  \articlenote
  In the |article| version, you must include |hyperref| manually if
  you want to use it. It is not included automatically.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{inputenc}|[|\declare{|utf8|}|]|}
  \beamernote
  When using Unicode, you may wish to use one of the following class
  options: 
  \begin{classoption}{{ucs}}
    Loads the package |ucs| and passes the correct Unicode options to
    |hyperref|. Also, it preloads the Unicode code pages zero and
    one.
  \end{classoption}
  
  \begin{classoption}{{utf8}}
    Same as the option |ucs|, but also sets the input encoding to
    |utf8|. You could also use the option |ucs| and say
    |\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}| in the preamble.
  \end{classoption}

  If you use a Unicode character outside the first two code pages
  (which includes the Latin alphabet and the extended Latin alphabet)
  in a section or subsection heading, you have to use the command
  |\PreloadUnicodePage{|\meta{code  page}|}| to give |ucs| a chance to
  preload these code pages. You will know that a character has not
  been preloaded, if you get a message like ``Please insert into
  preamble.'' The code page of a character is given by the unicode
  number of the character divided by 256.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{listings}}
  \beamernote
  Note that you must treat |lstlisting| environments exactly the same
  way as you would treat |verbatim| environments. When using
  |\defverbatim| that contains a colored |lstlisting|, use the
  |colored| option of |\defverbatim|.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{msc}}
  \beamernote
  Since this packages uses |pstricks| internally, everything that
  applies to pstricks also applies to |msc|.
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{musixtex}}
  When using  MusiX\TeX\ to typeset musical scores, your document must
  be compiled with |pdfelatex| or |elatex| instead of |pdflatex| or
  |latex|.  

  Inside  a |music| environment, the |\pause| is redefined to match
  MusiX\TeX's definition (a rest during one quarter of a whole). You can
  use the |\beamerpause| command  to create overlays in this
  environment.  
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{pdfpages}}
  Commands like |\includepdf| only work \emph{outside} frames as they
  produce pages ``by themselves.'' You may also wish to say
  |\usebackgroundtemplate{}| when you use such a command since the
  background (even a white background) will otherwise be printed over
  the image you try to include.

  \example
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
  \titlepage
\end{frame}

{
  \usebackgroundtemplate{}
  \includepdf{somepdfimages.pdf}
}

\begin{frame}
  A normal frame.
\end{frame}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{\normalfont\meta{professional font package}}}
  \beamernote
  If you use a professional font package, \beamer's internal
  redefinition of how variables are typeset may interfere with the
  font package's superior way of typesetting them. In this case, you
  should use the class option |professionalfont| to suppress any font
  substitution. See Section~\ref{section-substition} for details.
\end{package}

\begin{class}{{prosper}}
  If you wish to (partly) emulate the |prosper| class using \beamer,
  please see Section~\ref{section-prosper}.
\end{class}

\begin{package}{{pstricks}}
  You should add the option |xcolor=pst| to make |xcolor| aware of the
  fact that you are using |pstricks|.
\end{package}

\begin{class}{{seminar}}
  If you wish to emulate the |seminar| class using \beamer, please see
  Section~\ref{section-seminar}.
\end{class}

\begin{package}{{texpower}}
  You cannot use this package with \beamer. However, you might try to
  use the package |beamertexpower| instead, see
  Section~\ref{section-texpower}.  
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{textpos}}
  \beamernote
  \beamer\ automatically installs a white background behind
  everything, unless you install a different background
  template. Because of this, you must use the |overlay| option when
  using |textpos|, so that it will place boxes \emph{before}
  everything. Alternatively, you can install an empty background
  template, but this may result in an incorrect display in certain
  situtations with older versions of the Acrobat Reader. 
\end{package}

\begin{package}{{ucs}}
  See |\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}|.
\end{package}


\begin{package}{{xcolor}}
  \beamernote
  The |xcolor| package is automatically loaded by |beamer.cls|. The
  same applies as to |color|.

  \begin{classoption}{{xcolor={\normalfont\meta{list of options}}}}
    Causes the \meta{list of options} to be passed on to the |xcolor|
    package.
  \end{classoption}

  When using \beamer\ together with the |pstricks| package, be sure to
  pass the |xcolor=pst| option to \beamer\ (and hence to |xcolor|).

  \articlenote
  The |color| package is not loaded automatically if
  |beamerarticle| is loaded with the |noxcolor| option.
\end{package}





\subsection{Emulation of other Classes}

The \beamer\ class comes with a number of emulation layer for classes
or packages that do not support \beamer\ directly. For example, the
package |beamerseminar| maps some (not all) commands of the \seminar\ 
class to appropriate \beamer\ commands. This way, individual slides or
whole sets of slides that have been prepared for a presentation using
\seminar\ can be used inside \beamer, provided they are reasonably
simple.

None of the emulation layers is a perfect substitute for the original
(emulations seldom are) and it is not intended that they ever will
be. If you want/need/prefer the features of another class, use that
class for preparing your presentations. The intension of these layers
is just to help speed up creating \beamer\ presentations that use
parts of old presentations. You can simply copy these parts in
verbatim, without having to worry about the subtle differences in
syntax. 

A useful effect of using an emulation layer is that you get access to
all the features of \beamer\ while using the syntax of another
class. For example, you can use the |article| mode to create a
nice article version of a \prosper\ talk.



\subsubsection{Prosper and HA-Prosper}
\label{section-prosper}

The package |beamerprosper| maps the commands of the \prosper\
package, developped by Fr\'ed\'eric Goualard, to \beamer\
commands. Also, some commands of the \textsc{ha}-\prosper\ package,
developped by Hendri Adriaens, are mapped to \beamer\ commands. 
\emph{These mappings cannot perfectly emulate all of Prosper!} Rather,
these mappings are intended as an aid when porting parts of
presentations created using \prosper\ to \beamer. \emph{No styles are
  implemented that mimick Prosper styles.} Rather, the normal \beamer\
themes must be used (although, one could implement \beamer\ themes
that mimicks existing \prosper\ styles; I have not done that and do
not intend to).

The workflow for creating a \beamer\ presentation that uses \prosper\
code is the following: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Use the document class |beamer|, not |prosper|. Most options
  passed to |prosper| do not apply to |beamer| and should be omitted.
\item
  Add a |\usepackage{beamerprosper}| to start the emulation.
\item
  If you add slides relying on \textsc{ha}-\prosper, you may wish to
  add the option |framesassubsections| to |beamerprosper|, though I do
  not recommend it (use the normal |\subsection| command instead; it
  gives you more fine-grained control).
\item
  If you also copy the title commands, it may be necessary to adjust
  the content of commands like |\title| 
  or |\author|. Note that in \prosper\ the |\email| command is given
  outside the |\author| command, whereas in \beamer\ and also in
  \textsc{ha}-\prosper\ it is given inside.
\item
  When copying slides containing the command |\includegraphics|, you
  will almost surely have to adjust its usage. If you use pdf\LaTeX\
  to typeset the presentation, than you cannot include PostScript
  file. You should convert them to |.pdf| or to |.png| and adjust any
  usage of |\includegraphics| accordingly.
\item
  When starting to change things, you can use all of \beamer's
  commands and even mix them with \prosper\ commands.
\end{enumerate}

An example can be found in the file |beamerexample-prosper.tex|.

There are, unfortunately, quite a few places where you may run into
problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  In \beamer, the command |\PDForPS| will do exactly what the name
  suggests: insert the first argument when run by |pdflatex|, insert
  the second argument when run by |latex|. However, in \prosper, the
  code inserted for the \pdf\ case is actually PostScript code, which
  is only later converted to \pdf\ by some external program. You will
  need to adjust this PostScript code such that it works with
  |pdflatex| (which is not always possible).
\item
  If you used fine-grained spacing commands, like adding a little
  horizontal skip   here and a big negative vertical skip there, the
  typesetting of the text may be poor. It may be a good idea to just
  remove these spacing commands.
\item
  If you use |pstricks| commands, you will either have to stick to
  using |latex| and |dvips| or will have to work around them using,
  for example, |pgf|. Porting lot's of |pstricks| code is bound to be
  difficult, if you wish to switch over to |pdflatex|, so be warned.
\item
  If the file cannot be compiled because some \prosper\ command is not
  implemented, you will have to delete this command and try to mimick
  its behaviour using some \beamer\ command.
\end{itemize}


\begin{package}{{beamerprosper}}
  Include this package in a |beamer| presentation to get access to
  \prosper\ commands. Use |beamer| as the document class, not
  |prosper|. Most of the options passed to the class |prosper| make no
  sense in |beamer|, so just delete them.

  This package takes the following options:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \declare{|framesassubsections|} causes each frame to create its
    own subsection with the frame title as subsection name. This
    behaviour mimicks \textsc{ha}-\textsc{prosper}'s behaviour. In a
    long talk this will create way too many subsections. 
  \end{itemize}

  \articlenote
  The |framesassubsections| option has no effect in |article| mode.

  \example
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[notes]{beamer}

\usepackage[framesassubsections]{beamerprosper}
\mode<presentation>
{
  \definecolor{beamerstructure}{RGB}{43,79,112}
  \definecolor{sidebackground}{RGB}{230,242,250}
  \color{beamerstructure}
  \usepackage[tab,width=3.25cm]{beamerthemesidebar}
  \usepackage{times}
  \userightsidebarcolortemplate{\color{sidebackground}}
  \beamertemplateballitem
  \beamertemplateboldframetitle
  \beamertemplateboldtitlepage
}

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
  
  You can run, for example, pdf\LaTeX\ on the file to get a \beamer\
  presentation with overlays. Adding the |notes| option will also show
  the note. Certain commands, like |\LeftFoot|, are ignored. You can
  change the theme using the usual commands. You can also use all
  normal \beamer\ commands and concepts, like overlay-specifications,
  in the file. You can also create an |article| version by using the
  class |article| and including the package |beamerarticle|.
\end{package}

In the following, the effect of \prosper\ commands in \beamer\ are
listed.

\begin{command}{\email\marg{text}}
  Simply typesets its argument in typewriter text. Should hence be
  given \emph{inside} the |\author| command.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\institution\marg{text}}
  This command is mapped to \beamer's |\institute|
  command if given \emph{outside} the |\author| command, otherwise it
  typesets its argument in a smaller font.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\Logo\opt{|(|\meta{x}|,|\meta{y}|)|}\marg{logo text}}
  This is mapped to |\logo{|\meta{logo text}|}|. The coordinates are ignored.
\end{command}

\begin{environment}{{slides}\oarg{options}\marg{frame title}}
  Inserts a frame with the |containsverbatim| option set. The
  \meta{frame title} will be enclosed in a |\frametitle| command.

  The following \meta{options} may be given:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \declare{|trans=|\meta{prosper transition}} installs the specified
    \meta{prosper transition} as the transition effect when showing
    the slide.
  \item
    \declare{\meta{prosper transition}} has the same effect as
    |trans=|\meta{prosper transition}.
  \item
    \declare{|toc=|\meta{entry}} overrides the subsection table of
    contents entry created by this slide by \meta{entry}. Note that a
    subsection entry is created for a slide only if the
    |framesassubsections| options is specified.
  \item
    \declare{|template|=\meta{text}} is ignored.
  \end{itemize}

  \example The following two texts have the same effect:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{slide}[trans=Glitter,toc=short]{A Title}
  Hi!
\end{slide}
\end{verbatim}

  and

\begin{verbatim}
\subsection{short} % omitted, if framesassubsections is not specified
\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]
  \transglitter
  \frametitle{A Title}
  Hi!
\end{frame}
\end{verbatim}
\end{environment}


\begin{command}{\overlays\marg{number}\marg{slide environment}}
  This will put the \meta{slide environment} into a frame that does
  not have the |containsverbatim| option and which can hence contain
  overlayed text. The \meta{number} is ignored since the number of
  necessary overlays is computed automatically by \beamer.

  \example The following code fragments have the same effect:
  
\begin{verbatim}
\overlays{2}{
\begin{slide}{A Title}
  \begin{itemstep}
  \item Hi!
  \item Ho!
  \end{itemstep}
\end{slide}}
\end{verbatim}

  and

\begin{verbatim}
\subsection{A Title} % omitted, if framesassubsections is not specified
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A Title}
  \begin{itemstep}
  \item Hi!
  \item Ho!
  \end{itemstep}
\end{frame}
\end{verbatim}
\end{command}


\begin{command}{\fromSlide\marg{slide number}\marg{text}}
  This is mapped to |\uncover<|\meta{slide number}|->{|\meta{text}|}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\fromSlide|*|\marg{slide number}\marg{text}}
  This is mapped to |\only<|\meta{slide number}|->{|\meta{text}|}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\onlySlide\marg{slide number}\marg{text}}
  This is mapped to |\uncover<|\meta{slide number}|>{|\meta{text}|}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\onlySlide|*|\marg{slide number}\marg{text}}
  This is mapped to |\only<|\meta{slide number}|>{|\meta{text}|}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\untilSlide\marg{slide number}\marg{text}}
  This is mapped to |\uncover<-|\meta{slide number}|>{|\meta{text}|}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\untilsSlide|*|\marg{slide number}\marg{text}}
  This is mapped to |\only<-|\meta{slide number}|>{|\meta{text}|}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\FromSlide\marg{slide number}}
  This is mapped to |\onslide<|\meta{slide number}|->|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\OnlySlide\marg{slide number}}
  This is mapped to |\onslide<|\meta{slide number}|>|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\UntilSlide\marg{slide number}}
  This is mapped to |\onslide<-|\meta{slide number}|>|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\slideCaption\marg{text}}
  This is mapped to |\date{|\meta{text}|}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\fontTitle\marg{text}}
  Simply inserts \meta{text}.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\fontText\marg{text}}
  Simply inserts \meta{text}.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\PDFtransition\marg{prosper transition}}
  Maps the \meta{prosper transition} to an appropriate |\transxxxx|
  command.
\end{command}

\begin{environment}{{Itemize}}
  This is mapped to |itemize|.
\end{environment}

\begin{environment}{{itemstep}}
  This is mapped to |itemize| with the option |[<+->]|.
\end{environment}

\begin{environment}{{enumstep}}
  This is mapped to |enumerate| with the option |[<+->]|.
\end{environment}

\begin{command}{\hiddenitem}
  This is mapped to |\addtocounter{beamerpauses}{1}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\prosperpart\oarg{options}\marg{text}}
  This command has the same effect as \prosper's |\part|
  command. \beamer's normal |\part| command retains its normal
  sematics. Thus, you might wish to replace all occurences of |\part|
  by |\prosperpart|.
\end{command}


\begin{command}{\tsection\opt{|*|}\marg{section name}}
  Creates a section named \meta{section name}. The star, if present,
  is ignored.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\tsectionandpart\opt{|*|}\marg{part text}}
  Mapped to a |\section| command followed by a |\prosperpart|
  command.

  \articlenote
  In |article| mode, no part page is added.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\dualslide\oarg{x}\oarg{y}\oarg{z}\marg{options}\marg{left
      column}\marg{right column}}
  This command is mapped to a |columns| environment. The \meta{left
    column} text is shown in the left column, the \meta{right column}
  text is shown in the right column. The options \meta{x}, \meta{y},
  and \meta{z} are ignored. Also, all \emph{options} are ignored,
  except for \declare{|lcolwidth=|} and \declare{|rcolwidth=|}. These
  set the width of the left or right column, respectively.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\PDForPS\marg{PostScript text}\marg{PDF text}}
  Inserts either the \meta{PostScript text} or the \meta{PDF text},
  depending on whether |latex| or |pdflatex| is used. When porting,
  the \meta{PDF text} will most likely be \emph{incorrect}, since in
  \prosper\ the \meta{PDF text} is actually PostScript text that is
  later transformed to \pdf\ by some external program.

  If the \meta{PDF text} contains an |\includegraphics| command (which
  is its usual use), you should change the name of the graphic file
  that is included to a name ending |.pdf|, |.png|, or
  |.jpg|. Typically, you will have to convert your graphic to this
  format.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\onlyInPDF\meta{PDF text}}
  The \meta{PDF text} is only included if |pdflatex| is used. The same
  as for the command |\PDForPS| applies here.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\onlyInPS\meta{PS text}}
  The \meta{PS text} is only included if |latex| is used. 
\end{command}

\begin{environment}{{notes}\marg{title}}
  Mapped to |\note{\textbf{|\meta{title}|}|\meta{environment contents}|}|
  (more or less). 
\end{environment}

The following commands are parsed by \beamer, but have no effect:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep=0pt\parskip=0pt
\item |\myitem|,
\item |\FontTitle|,
\item |\FontText|,
\item |\ColorFoot|,
\item |\DefaultTransition|,
\item |\NoFrenchBabelItemize|,
\item |\TitleSlideNav|,
\item |\NormalSlideNav|,
\item |\HAPsetup|,
\item |\LeftFoot|, and
\item |\RightFoot|.
\end{itemize}




\subsubsection{Seminar}
\label{section-seminar}

The package |beamerseminar| maps a subset of the commands of the \seminar\
package to \beamer. As for \prosper, the emulation cannot be
perfect. For example, no portrait slides are supported, no
automatic page breaking, the framing of slides is not
emulated. Unfortunately, for all frames (|slide| environments) that
contain overlays, you have to put the environment into a |frame|
environment ``by hand'' and must remove all occurences of |\newslide|
inside the environment by closing the slide and opening a new one (and
then putting these into |frame| environments).

The workflow for the migration is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Use the document class |beamer|, not |seminar|. Most options
  passed to |seminar| do not apply to |beamer| and should be
  omitted.
\item
  If you copy parts of a presentation that is mixed with normal text,
  add the |ignorenonframetext| option and place \emph{every} |slide|
  environment inside a |frame| since \beamer\ will not recognize the 
  |\begin{slide}| as the beginning of a frame.
\item
  Add a |\usepackage{beamerseminar}| to start the emulation. Add the
  option |accumulate| if you wish to create a presentation to be held
  with a video projector.
\item
  Possibly add commands to install themes and templates.
\item
  The should be not commands in the preamble having to do with
  page and slide styles. They do not apply to |beamer|.
\item
  If a |\newslide| command is used in a |slide| (or similarly
  |slide*|) environment that contains an overlay, you must replace it
  by a closing |\end{slide}| and an opening |\begin{slide}|. 
\item
  Next, for each |slide| or |slide*| environment that contains an
  overlay, you must place a |frame| environment around it. You can
  remove the |slide| environment (and hence effectively replace it by
  |frame|), unless you use the |accumulate| option. 
\item
  If you use |\section| or |\subsection| commands inside slides, you
  will have to move them \emph{outside} the frames. It may then be
  necessary to add a |\frametitle| command to the slide.
\item
  If you use pdf\LaTeX\ to typeset the presentation, you cannot
  include PostScript files. You should convert them to |.pdf| or to
  |.png| and adjust any usage of |\includegraphics| accordingly.
\item
  When starting to change things, you can use all of \beamer's
  commands and even mix them with \seminar\ commands.
\end{enumerate}

An example can be found in the file |beamerexample-seminar.tex|.

There are, unfortunately, numerous places where you may run into
problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  The whole |note| management of |seminar| is so different from
  |beamer|'s, that you will have to edit notes ``by hand.'' In
  particular, commands like |\ifslidesonly| and |\ifslide| may not do
  exactly what you expect.
\item
  If you use |pstricks| commands, you will either have to stick to
  using |latex| and |dvips| or will have to work around them using,
  for example, |pgf|. Porting lot's of |pstricks| code is bound to be
  difficult, if you wish to switch over to |pdflatex|, so be warned.
\item
  If the file cannot be compiled because some \seminar\ command is not
  implemented, you will have to delete this command and try to mimick
  its behaviour using some \beamer\ command.
\end{itemize}

\begin{package}{{beamerseminar}}
  Include this package in a |beamer| presentation to get access to
  \seminar\ commands. Use |beamer| as the document class, not
  |seminar|. Most of the options passed to the class |seminar| make no
  sense in |beamer|, so just delete them.

  This package takes the following options:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \declare{|accumulate|} causes overlays to be accumulated. The
    original behaviour of the \seminar\ package is that in each
    overlay only the really ``new'' part of the overlay is shown. This
    makes sense, if you really print out the overlays on
    transparencies and then really stack overlays on top of each
    other. For a presentation with a video projector, you rather
    want to present an ``accumulated'' version of the overlays. This
    is what this option does: When the new material of the $i$th
    overlay is shown, the material of all previous overlays is also
    shown. 
  \end{itemize}

  \example
  The following example is an extract of |beamerexample-seminar.tex|:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[ignorenonframetext]{beamer}
\usepackage[accumulated]{beamerseminar}
\usepackage{beamerthemeclassic}

\title{A beamer presentation using seminar commands}
\author{Till Tantau}

\let\heading=\frametitle

\begin{document}

\begin{frame}
  \maketitle
\end{frame}

This is some text outside any frame. It will only be shown in the
article version.

\begin{frame}
  \begin{slide}
    \heading{This is a frame title.}

    \begin{enumerate}
      {\overlay1
      \item Overlays are a little tricky in seminar.
        {\overlay2
        \item But it is possible to use them in beamer.
        }
      }
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{slide}
\end{frame}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

  You can use all normal \beamer\ commands and concepts, like
  overlay-specifications, in the file. You can also create an
  |article| version by using the class |article| and
  including the package |beamerarticle|. 
\end{package}

In the following, the effect of \seminar\ commands in \beamer\ are
listed.

\begin{command}{\overlay\marg{number}}
  Shows the material till the end of the current \TeX\ group only on
  overlay numbered $\hbox{\meta{number}}+1$ or, if the |accumulate|
  option is given, from that overlay on. Usages of this command may be
  nested (as in \seminar). If an |\overlay| command is given inside
  another, it temporarily ``overrules'' the outer one as demonstrated
  in the following example, where it is assumed that the |accumulate|
  option is given.

  \example
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{frame}
  \begin{slide}
    This is shown from the first slide on.
    {\overlay{2}
      This is shown from the third slide on.
      {\overlay{1}
        This is shown from the second slide on.
      }
      This is shown once more from the third slide on.
    }
  \end{slide}
\end{frame}
\end{verbatim}
\end{command}


\begin{environment}{{slide\opt{|*|}}}
  Mainly installs an |\overlay{0}| around the \meta{environment
    contents}. If the |accumulate| option is given, this has no
  effect, but otherwise it will cause the main text of the slide to be
  shown \emph{only} on the first slide. This is useful if you really
  wish to physically place slides on top of each other.

  The starred version does the same as the nonstarred one.

  If this command is not issued inside a |\frame|, it sets up a frame
  with the |containsverbatim| option set. Thus, this frame will
  contain only a single slide.

  \example
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{slide}
  Some text.
\end{slide}

\frame{
\begin{slide}
  Some text. And an {\overlay{1} overlay}.
\end{slide}
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{environment}

\begin{command}{\red}
  Mapped to |\color{red}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\blue}
  Mapped to |\color{blue}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\green}
  Mapped to |\color{green}|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\ifslide}
  True in the |presentation| modes, false in the |article| mode.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\ifslidesonly}
  Same as |\ifslide|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\ifarticle}
  False in the |presentation| modes, true in the |article| mode.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\ifportrait}
  Always false.
\end{command}

The following commands are parsed by \beamer, but have no effect:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep=0pt\parskip=0pt
\item |\ptsize|.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Foil\TeX}
\label{section-foiltex}

The package |beamerfoils| maps a subset of the commands of the \foils\
package to \beamer. Since this package defines only few non-standard
\TeX\ commands and since \beamer\ implements all the standard
commands, the emulation layer is pretty simple. 

A copyright notice: The Foil\TeX\ package has a restricted
license. For this reason, no example from the \foils\ package is
included in the \beamer\ class. The emulation itself does not use the
code of the \foils\ package (rather, it just maps \foils\ commands to
\beamer\ commands). For this reason, my understanding is that the
\emph{emulation} offered by the \beamer\ class is ``free'' and legally
so. IBM has a copyright on the \foils\ class, not on the effect the
commands of this class have. (At least, that's my understanding of
things.) 

The workflow for the migration is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Use the document class |beamer|, not |foils|.
\item
  Add a |\usepackage{beamerfoils}| to start the emulation.
\item
  Possibly add commands to install themes and templates.
\item
  If the command |\foilhead| is used inside a |\frame| command or
  |frame| environment, it behaves like |\frametitle|. If it used
  outside a frame, it will start a new frame (with the
  |allowframebreaks| option, thus no overlays are allowed). This frame
  will persist till the next occurrence of |\foilhead| or of the new
  command |\endfoil|. Note that a |\frame| command will \emph{not} end
  a frame started using |\foilhead|. 
\item
  If you rely on automatic frame creation based on |\foilhead|, you
  will need to insert an |\endfoil| before the end of the document to
  end the last frame.
\item
  If you use pdf\LaTeX\ to typeset the presentation, than you cannot
  include PostScript files. You should convert them to |.pdf| or to
  |.png| and adjust any usage of |\includegraphics| accordingly.
\item
  Sizes of objects are different in \beamer, since the scaling is done
  by the viewer, not by the class. Thus a framebox of size 6 inches
  will be way too big in a \beamer\ presentation. You will have to
  manually adjust explicit dimension occuring in a foil\TeX\ presentation.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{package}{{beamerfoils}}
  Include this package in a |beamer| presentation to get access to
  \foils\ commands. Use |beamer| as the document class, not
  |foils|.

  \example In the following example, frames are automatically
  created. The |\endfoil| at the end is needed to close the last
  frame. 
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{beamerfoils}
  
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\foilhead{First Frame}

This is on the first frame.
\pagebreak
This is on the second frame, which is a continuation of the first. 

\foilhead{Third Frame}

This is on the third frame.

\endfoil
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
  
  \example In this example, frames are manually inserted. No
  |\endfoil| is needed.
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{beamerfoils}
  
\begin{document}

\frame{\maketitle}

\frame{
\foilhead{First Frame}
This is on the first frame.
}

\frame{
\foilhead{Second Frame}
This is on the second frame.
}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
\end{package}


In the following, the effect of \foils\ commands in \beamer\ are
listed.

\begin{command}{\MyLogo\marg{logo text}}
  This is mapped to |\logo|, though the logo is internally stored,
  such that it can be switched on and off using |\LogoOn| and |\LogoOff|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\LogoOn}
  Makes the logo visible.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\LogoOff}
  Makes the logo invisible.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\foilhead\oarg{dimension}\marg{frame title}}
  If used inside a |\frame| command or |frame| environment, this is
  mapped to |\frametitle{|\meta{frame title}|}|. If used outside any
  frames, a new frame is started with the option
  |allowframebreaks|. If a frame was previously started using this
  command, it will be closed before the next frame is started. The
  \meta{dimension} is ignored. 
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\rotatefoilhead\oarg{dimension}\marg{frame title}}
  This command has exactly the same effect as |\foilhead|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\endfoil}
  This is a command that is \emph{not} available in \foils. In
  \beamer, it can be used to end a frame that has automatically been
  opened using |\foildhead|. This command must be given before the end
  of the document if the last frame was opened using |\foildhead|.  
\end{command}

\begin{environment}{{boldequation\opt{|*|}}}
  This is mapped to the |equation| or the |equation*| environment,
  with |\boldmath| switched on.
\end{environment}

\begin{command}{\FoilTeX}
  Typests the foil\TeX\ name as in the \foils\ package.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\bm\marg{text}}
  Implemented as in the \foils\ package.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\bmstyle\marg{text}\marg{more text}}
  Implemented as in the \foils\ package.
\end{command}

The following additional theorem-like environments are predefined:
\begin{itemize}
\item |Theorem*|,
\item |Lemma*|,
\item |Corollary*|,
\item |Proposition*|,
\item |Definition*|.
\end{itemize}
For example, the first is defined using |\newtheorem*{Theorem*}{Theorem}|. 

The following commands are parsed by \beamer, but have not effect:
\begin{itemize}
\item |\leftheader|,
\item |\rightheader|,
\item |\leftfooter|,
\item |\rightfooter|,
\item |\Restriction|, and
\item |\marginpar|.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{\TeX Power}
\label{section-texpower}

The package |beamertexpower| maps a subset of the commands of the
\texpower\ package, due to Stephan Lehmke, to \beamer. This subset is
currently rather small, so a lot of adaptions may be necessary. Note
that \texpower\ is not a full class by itself, but a package that
needs another class, like |seminar| or |prosper| to do the actualy
typesetting. It may thus be necessary to additionally load an
emulation layer for these also. Indeed, it \emph{might} be possible to
directly use \texpower\ inside \beamer, but I have not tried
that. Perhaps this will be possible in the future.

Currently, the package |beamertexpower| mostly just maps the
|\stepwise| and related commands to appropriate \beamer\ commands. The
|\pause| command need not be mapped since it is directly implemented
by \beamer\ anyway.

The workflow for the migration is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Replace the document class by |beamer|. If the document class is
  |seminar| or |prosper|, you can use the above emulation layers, that
  is, you can include the files |beamerseminar| or |beamerprosper| to
  emulate the class.

  All notes on what to do for the emulation of \seminar\ or \prosper\
  also apply here.
\item
  Additionally, add |\usepackage{beamertexpower}| to start the
  emulation.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{package}{{beamertexpower}}
  Include this package in a |beamer| presentation to get access to the
  \texpower\ commands having to do with the |\stepwise| command.
\end{package}

A note on the |\pause| command: Both \beamer\ and \texpower\ implement
this command and they have the same semantics; so there is no need to
map this command to anything different in |beamertexpower|. However, a
difference is that |\pause| can be used almost anywhere in \beamer,
whereas is may only be used in non-nested situtations in \texpower. Since
\beamer\ is only more flexible than \texpower\ here, this will not
cause problems when porting.

In the following, the effect of \texpower\ commands in \beamer\ are
listed.

\begin{command}{\stepwise\marg{text}}
  As in \TeX Power, this initiates text in which commands like |\step|
  or |\switch| may be given. Text contained in a |\step| command will
  be enclosed in an |\only| command with the overlay specification
  |<+(1)->|. This means that the text of the first |\step| is inserted
  from the second slide onward, the text of the second |\step| is
  inserted from the third slide onward, and so on.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\parstepwise\marg{text}}
  Same as |\stepwise|, only |\uncover| is used instead of |\only| when
  mapping the |\step| command.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\liststepwise\marg{text}}
  Same as |\stepwise|, only an invisible horizontal line is inserted
  before the \meta{text}. This is presumable useful for solving some
  problems related to vertical spacing in \texpower. 
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\step\marg{text}}
  This is either mapped to |\only<+(1)->|\meta{text} or to
  |\uncover<+(1)->|\meta{text}, depending on whether this command is
  used inside a |\stepwise| environment or inside a |\parstepwise|
  environment. 
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\steponce\marg{text}}
  This is either mapped to |\only<+(1)>|\meta{text} or to
  |\uncover<+(1)>|\meta{text}, depending on whether this command is
  used inside a |\stepwise| environment or inside a |\parstepwise|
  environment. 
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\switch\marg{alternate text}\marg{text}}
  This is mapped to |\alt<+(1)->{|\meta{text}|}{|\meta{alternate
      text}|}|. Note that the arguments are swapped.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\bstep\marg{text}}
  This is always mapped to |\uncover<+(1)->|\meta{text}.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\dstep}
  This just advances the counter |beamerpauses| by one. It has no
  other effect.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\vstep}
  Same as |\dstep|.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\restep\marg{text}}
  Same as |\step|, but the \meta{text} is shown one the same slide as
  the previous |\step| command. This is implemented by first
  decreasing the countern  |beamerpauses| by one before calling
  |\step|. 
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\reswitch\marg{alternate text}\meta{text}}
  Like |\restep|, only for the |\switch| command.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\rebstep\meta{text}}
  Like |\restep|, only for the |\bstep| command.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\redstep}
  This command has no effect.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\revstep}
  This command has no effect.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\boxedsteps}
  Temporarily (for the current \TeX\ group) changes the effect of
  |\step| to issue an |\uncover|, even if used inside a |\stepwise|
  environment. 
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\nonboxedsteps}
  Temporarily (for the current \TeX\ group) changes the effect of
  |\step| to issue an |\only|, even if used inside a |\parstepwise|
  environment. 
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\code\marg{text}}
  Typesets the argument using a boldface typewriter font.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\codeswitch}
  Switches to a boldface typewriter font.
\end{command}
