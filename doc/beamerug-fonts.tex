\section{Fonts}

The first subsection introduces the predefined font
themes that come with \beamer\ and which make it easy to change the
fonts used in a presentation. The next subsection describes further
special commands for changing some basic attributes of the fonts used in a 
presentation. The last subsection explains how you can get a much more
fine-grained control over the fonts used for every individual element
of a presentation. 





\subsection{Font Themes}

\beamer\ comes with a set of font themes. When you use such a thme,
certain fonts are changed as described below. You can use several font
themes in concert. For historical reasons, you cannot change all
aspects of the fonts used using font themes---in same cases special
commands and options are needed, which are described in the next
subsection.

The following font themes only change certain font attributes, they do
not choose special font families (although that would also be possible
and themes doing just that might be added in the future). Currently,
to change the font family, you need to load special packages as
explained in the next subsection.


\begin{fontthemeexample}{default}
  The default font theme installs a sans serif font for all text of
  the presentation. The default theme installs different font sizes
  for things like titles or head- and footlines, but does not use
  boldface or italics for ``hilighting.'' To change some or all text
  to a serif font, use the |serif| theme.

  Note: The command |\mathrm| will always produce upright (not
  slanted), serif text and the command |\mathsf| will always produce
  upright, sans-serif text. The command |\mathbf| will produce
  upright, bold-face, sans-serif or serif text, depending on whether
  |mathsans| or |mathserif| is used.

  To produce an upright, sans-serif or serif text, depending on
  whether |mathsans| or |mathserif| is used, you can use for instance
  the command |\operatorname| from the |amsmath| package. Using this
  command instead of |\mathrm| or |\mathsf| directly will
  automatically adjust  upright mathematical text if you switch from
  sans-serif to serif or back.
\end{fontthemeexample}

\begin{fontthemeexample*}{professionalfonts}
  This font theme does not really change any fonts. Rather, it
  \emph{suppresses} certain internal replacements performed by
  \beamer. If you use ``professional fonts'' (fonts that you buy and
  that come with a complete set of every symbol in all modes), you do
  not want \beamer\ to meddle with the fonts you use.  \beamer\
  normally replaces certain character glyphs in mathematical text by
  more appropriate versions. For example, \beamer\ will normally
  replace glyphs such that the italic characters from the main font
  are used for variables in mathematical text. If your professional
  font package takes care of this already, \beamer's meddling should
  be switched off. Note that \beamer's substitution is automatically
  turned off if one of the following packages is loaded: |mathtime|,
  |mathpmnt|, |lucidabr|, |mtpro|, and |hvmath|. If your favorite
  professional font package is not among these, use the
  |professionalfont| option (and write me an email, so that the
  package can be added). 
\end{fontthemeexample*}



\begin{fontthemeexample}[\oarg{options}]{serif}
  This theme causes all text to be typeset using the default serif font
  (except if you specify certain \meta{options}). You might wish to
  consult Section~\ref{section-guidelines-serif} on whether you should
  use serif fonts.

  The following \meta{options} may be given:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \declare{|stillsansserifmath|}
    causes mathematical text still to be typeset using sans
    serif. This option only makes sense if you also use the
    |stillsansseriftext| option since sans serif math inside serif
    text look silly. 
  \item
    \declare{|stillsansserifsmall|}
    will cause ``small'' text to be still typeset using sans
    serif. This refers to the text in the headline, footline, and
    sidebars.  Using this options is often advisable since small text
    is often easier to read in sans serif.
  \item
    \declare{|stillsansseriflarge|}
    will cause ``large'' text like the presentation title or the frame
    title to be still typeset using sans serif. Sans serif titles with
    serif text are a popular combination in typography.
  \item
    \declare{|stillsansseriftext|}
    will cause normal text (none of the above three) to be still
    typeset using sans serif. If you use this option, you should most
    likely also use the first two. However, by not using
    |stillsansseriflarge|, you get a serif (possibly italic) title
    over a sans serif text. This can be an interesting visual
    effect. Naturally, ``interesting typographic effect'' can mean
    ``terrible typographic effect'' if you choose the wrong fonts
    combinations or sizes. You'll need some typographic experience to
    judge this correctly. If in doubt, try asking someone who should
    now. 
  \item
    \declare{|onlymath|}
    is a short-cut for selecting all of the above options except for
    the first. Thus, using this option causes only mathematical text
    to by typeset using a serif font. Recall that, by default,
    mathematical formulas are also typeset using sans-serif
    letters. In most cases, this is visually the most pleasing and
    easily readable way of typesetting mathematical formulas if the
    surrounding text is typeset using sans serif. However,
    in mathematical texts the font used to render, say, a variable is
    sometimes used to differentiate between different meanings of this
    variable. In such case, it may be necessary to typeset
    mathematical text using serif letters. Also, if you have a lot of
    mathematical text, the audience may be quicker to ``parse'' it if
    it is typeset the way people usually read mathematical text: in a
    serif font. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{fontthemeexample}



\begin{fontthemeexample}[\oarg{options}]{structurebold}
  This font theme will cause titles and text in the headlines,
  footlines, and sidebars to be typeset in a bold font.

  The following \meta{options} may be given:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \declare{|onlysmall|}
    will cause only ``small'' text to be typeset in bold. More
    precisely, only the text in the headline, footline, and sidebars
    is changed to be typeset in bold. Large titles are not affected.
  \item
    \declare{|onlylarge|}
    will cause only ``large'' text to be typeset in bold. These are
    the main title, frame titles, and section entries in the table of
    contents.     
  \end{itemize}

  As pointed out in Section~\ref{section-sizes}, you should use this
  theme (possibly with the |onlysmall| option) if your font is not
  scaled down properly or for light-on-dark text.

  The normal themes do not install this theme by default, while the
  old compatibility themes do. Since you can reload the theme once it
  has been loaded, you cannot use this theme with the old
  compatibility themes to set also titles to a bold font. 
\end{fontthemeexample}

\begin{fontthemeexample}[\oarg{options}]{structureitalicserif}
  This theme is similarly as the |structurebold| font theme, but where
  |structurebold| makes text bold, this theme typesets it in italics and
  in the standard serif font. The same \meta{options} as for the
  |structurebold| theme are supported. See
  Section~\ref{section-italics} for the pros and cons 
  of using italics.  
\end{fontthemeexample}

\begin{fontthemeexample}[\oarg{options}]{structuresmallcapsserif}
  Again, this theme does exactly the same as the |structurebold| font theme,
  only this time text is set using small caps and a serif
    font. The same \meta{options} as for the |structurebold| theme are
  supported. See Section~\ref{section-smallcaps} for the pros and cons
  of using small caps.  
\end{fontthemeexample}






\subsection{Font Changes That Cannot Be Made Using Font Themes} 

While most font decisions can be made using font themes, for
historical reasons some changes can only be made using class
options or by loading special packages. These options are explained in
the following. Possibly, these options will be replaced by themes in
the future.


\subsubsection{Choosing a Font Size for Normal Text}

As pointed out in Section~\ref{section-sizes}, measuring the default
font size in points is not really a good idea for
presentations. Nevertheless, \beamer\ does just that, setting the
default font size to 11pt as usual. This may seem ridiculously small, but 
the actual size of each frame is just 128mm times 96mm and the viewer
application enlarges the font. By specifying a default font size
smaller than 11pt you can put more onto each slide, by specifying a
larger font size you can fit on less.

To specify the font size, you can use the following class options:

\begin{classoption}{8pt}
  This is way too small. Requires that the package |extsize|
  is installed.
\end{classoption}

\begin{classoption}{9pt}
  This is also too small. Requires that the package |extsize|
  is installed.
\end{classoption}

\begin{classoption}{10pt}
  If you really need to fit much onto each frame, use this
  option. Works without |extsize|.
\end{classoption}

\begin{classoption}{smaller}
  Same as the |10pt| option.
\end{classoption}

\begin{classoption}{11pt}
  The default font size. You need not specify this option.
\end{classoption}

\begin{classoption}{12pt}
  Makes all fonts a little bigger, which makes the text more
  readable. The downside is that less fits onto each frame.
\end{classoption}

\begin{classoption}{bigger}
  Same as the |12pt| option.
\end{classoption}

\begin{classoption}{14pt}
  Makes all fonts somewhat bigger. Requires |extsize| to be installed.
\end{classoption}

\begin{classoption}{17pt}
  This is about the default size of PowerPoint. Requires |extsize| to
  be installed. 
\end{classoption}

\begin{classoption}{20pt}
  This is really huge. Requires |extsize| to be installed.
\end{classoption}



\subsubsection{Choosing a Font Family}

\label{section-substition}

By default, \beamer\ uses the Computer Modern fonts. To change this,
you can use one of the prepared packages of \LaTeX's font
mechanism. For example, to change to Times/Helvetica, simply add 
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{mathptmx}
\usepackage{helvet}
\end{verbatim}
in your preamble. Note that if you do not use the |serif| font theme,
Helvetica (not Times) will be selected as the text font.

There may be many other fonts available on your
installation. Typically, at least some of the following packages
should be available: |avant|, |bookman|, |chancery|, |charter|,
|euler|, |helvet|, |mathtime|, |mathptm|, |mathptmx|, |newcent|,
|palatino|, |pifont|, |utopia|.



\subsubsection{Choosing a Font Encodings}
\label{section-font-encoding}

The same font can come in different encodings, which are (very roughly
spoken) the ways the characters of a text are mapped to glyphs (the
actual shape of a particular character in a particular font at a
particular size). In \TeX\ two encodings are often used: the
T1~encoding and the OT1~encoding (old T1~encoding).

Conceptually, the newer T1~encoding is preferable over the old
OT1~encoding. For example, hyphenation of words containing umlauts
(like the famous German word Fr\"aulein) will work only if you use the
T1~encoding. Unfortunately, only the bitmapped version of the Computer
Modern fonts are available in this encoding in a standard
installation. For this reason, using the T1~encoding will produce
\pdf\ files that render very poorly.

Most standard PostScript fonts are available in T1~encoding. For
example, you can use Times in the T1~encoding. The package |lmodern|
makes the standard Computer Modern fonts available in the
T1~encoding. Furthermore, if you use |lmodern| several extra fonts
become available (like a sans-serif boldface math) and extra symbols
(like proper guillemots).

To select the T1 encoding, use |\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}|. Thus, if
you have the |lmodern| fonts installed, you could write
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\end{verbatim}
to get beautiful outline fonts and correct hyphenation. Note, however,
that some versions of the |lmodern| package do not include correct
glyphs for ligatures like ``fi,'' which may cause
trouble. Double-check whether all ligatures are displayed correctly.
