2004-01-19 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed bugs with "jumping" blocks in overlays.
	- Fixed bug with tabbing in beamerbaseboxes.
	- Added work-around for problem with black background in older
	  versions of acroread.
	- Fixed problems with linebreak in short title and short author
	  in sidebar themes. 

	Added:
	- Added placement options to columns and column commands.
	- Added \column command.
	- Added label option to frames.
	- Added \againframe command for showing a frame again later on
	  (very useful!). 
	- Added \includeonlyframe command for typesetting only specific
	  frames. 
	- Added \AtBeginSection, \AtBeginSubsection, and \AtBeginPart
	  commands (very useful!).
	- Added \visible command (opposite of \invisible).
	- Added verse, quotation, and quote environments.
	- Added abstract environment (not very useful in my opinion).
	- Added colored option to \defverbatim for use with lstlisting.
	- Added grid density option to grid background.
	- Added professionalfont option.
	- Added automatic support of serif math minion fonts.
	- Added option to \pause command.
	- Includes enumerate.sty by default and allows one to use its
	  functionality in beamer.
	- Added dark and tab options to beamerthemesidebar. Other sidebar
	  themes no longer needed.
	- Added \noteitem and \notes commands.
	- Added templates for notes.
	- Added notes=onlyframeswithnotes option for generating only
	  frames that contain a note.
	- Added options to all \insertshortxxx commands.
	- Added option for passing arguments to color, xcolor, pgf, and
	  hyperref.
	- Added \action and actionenv environments.
	- Added the concept of actions to overlay specifications. For example,
	  \item<alert@2> will alert the item on the second slide and
	  \item<2-| alert@2> will furthermore have the item covered before
	  that.  
	- Added <> option to \newcommand and \newenvironment to make the
	  defined commands overlay-specification aware.
	- \only and \alt will now also accept an overlay specification
	  "at the end".
	- Block environments now accept overlay specification also before
	  the argument.
	- Added \lecture command and \includeonlylecture (useful for
	  lecture notes).  
	
	Changed:
	- Every frame is now put into a box internally. Slides will never
	  be split over two pages.
	- \pause commands now transcends blocks (very useful!)
	- Balls are now also used for enumerations, not just for itemize
	  in shadow theme. Use \beamertemplateenumeratealpha to get old
	  behaviour. 
	- Changed syntax of alert and structure templates.
	- Reworked internals of overlay management. Should produce
	  slightly shorter files.
	- Changed file names of .jpg and .png images to start with "beamer-"
	  to avoid name clashes.
	- Renamed \original to \beameroriginal because of clash with
	  lucidia font styles.
	- "Streamlined" themes to use the same basic templates.
	- \note command should be renamed to \notes outside frames (old
	  behaviour tolerated)
	- \nameslide command is now obsolete. Use the label= option
	  instead.
	- Removed notesonly option. Use notes=only.
	- Themes beamerthemesidebartab, beamerthemesidebardark, and
	  beamerthemesidebardarktab are now obsolete. Use
	  beamerthesesidebar will appropriate options instead.
	- Theme beamerthemetreebars obsolete. Use beamerthemetree with
          option bars instead.
	- Removed compressnotes option. Use \beamertemplatenotecompress
	  instead. 
	
	Removed:
	- Removed pauses environment (no longer needed).
	- Improved pgf makes \pgfonly superfluous. Use \only instead.
	- Removed reproducable .pdf example files from repository for
	  faster cvs checkout/checkin.
	- Removed \invisibleon command (was superfluous anyway).
	- Removed \mixinon command (was not very useful and clashes with
	  new \pause command; use \opaqueness instead).
	- Removed \newoverlaycommand and \renewoverlaycommand. Can be
	  better implemented using \newcommand<>.
	- Removed beamer/lyx/doc. Documentation is now incorporated in
	  the main user's guide.
	
	LyX:
	- Added a big example file beamerlyxexample1.lyx.
	- Changed \tableofcontents command so that options can be
	  given in LyX. 
	- Changed \frame command in LyX so that options can be given. 
	- Added overprint and overlayarea environments.
	- Added \againframe command.
	- Changed beamer.layout to use new command \column. Old environment
 	  no longer supported in lyx.

	  previous frame.
	- Documented the LyX interface in beameruserguide.pdf.
